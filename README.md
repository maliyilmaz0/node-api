# node-api
This is my thesis API between React Native-Face_Recognizer.
In this package you can upload photos from your React Native app to Main Server with base64 encoding and 
you can run the python script that responsible for the Image preproggresing. In this case it's listening on
http://localhost:3000/runscript for start the Script1.py. 

You just need to start the project with 'node index.js' with your terminal.

ENJOY!
